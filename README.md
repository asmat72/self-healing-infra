# self-healing-infra
“A self-healing system for cloud infrastructure using monitoring and automated recovery scripts.”

- 🎯 Objective:
      - Automatically detect service failures (e.g., NGINX down) and recover them using Prometheus     alerts, Alertmanager notifications, and Ansible automation.
      - Clone the repository:  
                “git clone    “https://github.com/asmat72/self-healing-infra.git”
  
- 🧰 Tools Used:
      - “Prometheus”.
      - “Alertmanager”
      - “Ansible”
      - “Shell Scripting”
      - “Ubuntu VM / Docker”
      - “NGINX”
  
  - 🚀 Setup Guide:
      - 🔧 Deploy NGINX:
      - 📈 Install Prometheus:
      - ⚠️ Create Alert Rules:
      - 📣 Configure Alertmanager:
      - 🧪  Build Webhook Listener:
      - 🔁 Create Ansible Playbook:
  
  - 🎬 Demo: Test and Capture:
      - Stop NGINX manually:
      - Prometheus detects failure up{job="nginx"} == 0
      - Alertmanager fires alert Alert routed to webhook:
      - NGINX restarts automatically Verified via   "systemctl status nginx" :
  
  - 📦 Deliverables:
      - Prometheus config:
      - Alertmanager webhook setup:
      - Ansible playbook:
      - Webhook listener:
      - Demo logs and screenshots:
   
  - 📚 Notes:
      - You can extend this setup to monitor other services or metrics (e.g., CPU, memory).
      - For production, secure the webhook and use remote Ansible hosts.
